/**
 * \class PACInterface
 * \brief Provides interface to implement automated polar alignment correction.
 *
 * A client sets the measured alignment error via the ALIGNMENT_CORRECTION_ERROR number property
 * (azimuth and altitude offsets in degrees), then commands a correction through the
 * ALIGNMENT_CORRECTION switch property.  The device applies the mechanical correction and
 * reports progress through the ALIGNMENT_CORRECTION_STATUS light property.
 *
 * In addition to fully-automated correction, the interface exposes manual step controls via the
 * PAC_MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT number property.  A client can nudge the mount by a signed number of
 * degrees on either axis independently:
 *
 * \b Sign convention for manual adjustments:
 *   - Azimuth (PAC_MANUAL_AZ_STEP):  positive value → East,  negative value → West
 *   - Altitude (PAC_MANUAL_ALT_STEP): positive value → North, negative value → South
 *
 * \b Relationship between errors and corrections:
 *   - A positive azimuth error means the polar axis is displaced to the East, so the correction
 *     moves the mount West: MoveAZ(−azError).
 *   - A positive altitude error means the polar axis is too high, so the correction moves the
 *     mount South: MoveALT(−altError).
 *
 * The default implementation of StartCorrection() uses MoveAZ() and MoveALT() so that any
 * driver implementing those two primitives automatically gains automated correction.
 *
 * The interface can be embedded in any device (typically a mount) via multiple inheritance,
 * or used as the basis of a standalone alignment-correction device.
 *
 * \e IMPORTANT: initProperties() must be called before any other function to initialize the
 *               alignment correction properties.
 * \e IMPORTANT: updateProperties() must be called in your driver's updateProperties().
 * \e IMPORTANT: processSwitch() must be called in your driver's ISNewSwitch().
 * \e IMPORTANT: processNumber() must be called in your driver's ISNewNumber().
